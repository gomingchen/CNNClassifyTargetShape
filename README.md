# CNNClassifyTargetShape [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gomingchen/CNNClassifyTargetShape/blob/main/trainMyCNN.ipynb)
A piece of python code used to train the convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify targets with 1, 2, 3, and 4 glints (a glint is a major reflecting surface).


The network consists of 4 CNN layers. 

+ [allinone.mat](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hnom9gJEn-y0GsAmxwRjeXjNy9aGten_/view?usp=sharing) contains the gammatone filterbank output of echoes generated from different targets.
* labels2.mat is the corresponding labels.
